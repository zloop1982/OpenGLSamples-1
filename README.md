Announcing the new NVIDIA GameWorks Graphics Samples
====================================================

You have reached the former location of NVIDIA’s GameWorks cross-platform OpenGL samples.  These samples have been moved, expanded and now support both OpenGL and Vulkan!  You may find the new samples at:

https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/GraphicsSamples

and the documentation at:

http://nvidiagameworks.github.io/GraphicsSamples

To avoid confusion, the final commit in this old repo has deleted the existing files at top-of-tree.  If you require access to the old samples, pull the previous commit.  However, we strongly recommend migrating to the new samples repository.  This repository should be considered closed, deprecated and slated for deletion.
